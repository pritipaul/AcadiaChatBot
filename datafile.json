        "There are many Don'ts that must be abiding by the students inside our campus, otherwise strict actions are taken by the college authority. \n Some of the Don'ts for the students are listed below: \n 1) Don’t rag and don’t be a mute witness to ragging. It is a criminal offense punishable under the Indian Penal Code. Strict disciplinary action will be taken against any student indulging in any form of ragging or Eve-Teasing inside or on the College premises or outside. \n 2) The College is your second home. Don’t litter the Campus. A clean and healthy environment will lead to a better tomorrow. \n 3) Smoking and/or consumption of any kind of alcoholic drinks/drugs inside the College is strictly prohibited. \n 4) Don’t use unfair means during examination. Misconduct during the examination, production of false information or documents for admission purposes, and the failure to return materials taken on loan from the College would be seriously dealt with. \n 5) Unruly gathering in groups at roads, entrances, exits, and pathways are strictly prohibited. \n For more information visit <a href=\"https://tint.edu.in/campus-life/dos-donts-for-students.html\">https://tint.edu.in/campus-life/dos-donts-for-students.html</a>"
